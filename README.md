# TODO-WEB
this is web application that provides API for my mobile application that i have been developing.
the reasons of making a website:
1. as my portofolio in fullstack engineering
2. spend my time on weekend because i dont know what i to do :(
3. implementation of golang language, that i got at the last semester in ruang guru camp as backend engineering
4. to help me manage my activities
5. I hope this app can help anyone to manage their activities
